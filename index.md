This course surveys how networks of neurons can perform computation. We will cover a variety of methods for designing and training neural networks. We will study some state-of-the-art methods for artificial neural networks, as well as some approaches that are guided by the biological constraints of the brain. We will look at both supervised and unsupervised learning. Other topics include population coding.
